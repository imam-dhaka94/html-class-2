			<!--<pre style="font-size:22px;">
				I wandered lonely as a cloud
				That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
				When all at once I saw a crowd,
				A host, of golden daffodils;
				Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
				Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

				Continuous as the stars that shine
				And twinkle on the milky way,
				They stretched in never-ending line
				Along the margin of a bay:
				Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
				Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

				The waves beside them danced; but they
				Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
				A poet could not but be gay,
				In such a jocund company:
				I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
				What wealth the show to me had brought:

				For oft, when on my couch I lie
				In vacant or in pensive mood,
				They flash upon that inward eye
				Which is the bliss of solitude;
				And then my heart with pleasure fills,
				And dances with the daffodils.
